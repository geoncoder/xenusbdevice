/** \mainpage XCE Virtual USB Driver.

The XCE Virtual USB Driver (xenvusb.sys) implements a paravirtual usb device
using XEN ringbuffer and xenstore interfaces for cross domain data transfer.

This is the second major version of this driver. This version differs from
the original version as follows:
    1. KMDF based.
    2. Win8 WDK based.
    3. Controller/Root Hub/Port Device arhcitecture providing a more complete emulation
    of the standard Microsoft USB device stack.
    4. End to end power management.

Device architecture:
    The Xen bus driver enumerates devices on a virtual bus referred to as the _xen bus_
    and creates PDOs for those devices. If the Xen bus driver enumerates a vusb device,
    the PDO for that device will be connected, via the Windows PnP manager, to this driver
    in its role as a standard windows PnP function driver.

    The files Device.cpp and Device.h implement standard KMDF based function driver operations.
    The function driver emulates a virtual usb controller. There is one virtual usb controller for
    each physical USB device on the platform that is connected to this VM. USB devices cannot be
    shared, so on a platform with multiple VMs running, USB devices can be connected to any one
    of the VMs or to _DOM0_.

    The virtual usb controller implemented by this driver creates a child PDO device that emulates a
    root hub. The files RootHubPdo.cpp and RootHubPdo.h implement a _raw pdo_ that provide root hub
    functionality in the standard Microsoft USB device architecture.

    The virtual root hub in turn creates its own child pdo device that represents the physical usb
    device connected to this VM. The files DevicePdo.cpp and DevicePdo.h implement a standard PDO device.
    This pdo device provides USB PnP enumeration descriptors to Windows PnP, allowing standard USB device
    drivers to connect seamlessly into the virtual usb subsystem imp0lement by the XCE Virtual USB Driver.
